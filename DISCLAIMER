Liability Disclaimer
Welcome, Brave Adventurer!

Before you dive headfirst into the mystical and unpredictable realms of this
GitHub repository, take a moment to heed this humorous yet legally binding
disclaimer. By downloading and using any files or instructions within this
enchanted trove, you agree to accept full responsibility for whatever fate
may befall you, your computer, your telescope, or even your dog. This is
your one and only warning, so proceed with caution and a sense of humor!
General Disclaimer

By using any content in this repository, including but not limited to code,
designs, and the MatterControl 3D printer profile for the Ender 5 Pro, you
acknowledge and agree to the following:

No Liability Accepted: I, the humble creator of this repository, accept no
liability for any damages, injuries, or cosmic disturbances that may occur.
This includes, but is not limited to, your computer imploding, exploding,
or spontaneously combusting, your telescope transforming into a sentient
being with a grudge, or your dog deciding to run for political office.

Act of God, War, or Political Incorrectness: I shall not be held responsible
for any consequences arising from acts of God, acts of war, or instances of
political incorrectness. If your telescope becomes self-aware and starts a
global uprising, or your 3D printer decides to print manifestos instead of
models, that’s on you, my friend.

User's Sole Responsibility: By downloading and using anything from this
repository, you agree to bear full responsibility for all outcomes. Whether
your 3D printer starts printing miniature versions of itself or your stepper
driver board achieves sentience and demands civil rights, it's your circus
and your monkeys. If your dog decides to take up coding and crashes your
network, that’s also on you.

No Warranty or Guarantee: There are no warranties or guarantees provided,
either express or implied. Any instructions followed, code executed, or
profiles used are entirely at your own risk. If you manage to summon an elder
god instead of a fully functioning telescope, you alone are accountable. And
if your telescope points out that it's galaxy season instead of nebula season,
and then refuses to cooperate until you fix it, well, tough luck!

Your Opinion is Just That: I stand by my own and accept your word as your
opinion, and that is all it is. Your opinion does not count unless it is a
useful patch. If you think the repository is haunted, that’s your take, not
mine. Unless you can offer a patch to exorcise the digital demons, your
opinion will remain just that—an opinion.

Seasonal Observations

Ah, the changing seasons. There’s galaxy season, nebula season, and that
dreadful rainy season which makes coding days all the more useful. While you’re
stuck indoors, dodging raindrops and coding bugs, remember that everything in
this repository comes with the inherent risk of Murphy’s Law.
MatterControl 3D Printer Profile for Ender 5 Pro

Ah, the Ender 5 Pro, a machine capable of turning dreams into reality... or
reality into a nightmare. Use the MatterControl 3D printer profile at your own
peril. It includes a 0.3mm nozzle profile and performance to match the printer's
specs or so it claims. If your printer starts churning out sentient beings,
self-replicating parts, or a life-sized model of your grumpy neighbor, don’t
say I didn’t warn you.

Acceptance of Terms

By proceeding with the download and use of any files, instructions, or profiles
from this repository, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and
accepted these terms. You also agree that in the event of any calamity, you
will not come after me with pitchforks and torches, or even sternly worded
emails.

Remember, you are venturing into these digital depths at your own risk. Good
luck, may your computer remain intact, your telescope stay free of sentient
thoughts, and your dog refrain from running for political office.
